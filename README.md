## Overview

This project is a full-stack application built using **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **ReactJS**. It implements a complete employee management system with the following features:
- User Authentication (Signup/Login)
- CRUD operations for employees
- Search functionality based on employee department or position
- Professional and responsive UI
- Session management with JWT and `localStorage`
- Deployment using Docker Compose or cloud platforms

---

## Backend Implementation

### Technologies Used (Backend)
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **MongoDB** (Mongoose)
- **JWT** for Authentication
- **Bcrypt.js** for Password Hashing

### API Endpoints
#### User Endpoints
- **POST /signup**: Create a new user account.
- **POST /login**: Authenticate the user and return a JWT token.

#### Employee Endpoints
- **POST /employees**: Add a new employee.
- **GET /employees**: Retrieve a list of all employees.
- **GET /employees/:id**: Retrieve details of a specific employee.
- **PUT /employees/:id**: Update information of a specific employee.
- **DELETE /employees/:id**: Delete an employee.
- **GET /employees/search**: Search employees by department or position.

### Validation & Error Handling
- **Validation**: All inputs are validated to ensure data integrity (e.g., required fields, unique usernames).
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and HTTP status codes are returned for various scenarios, including:
  - Invalid credentials during login.
  - Duplicate usernames during signup.
  - Missing or incorrect API parameters.

### Search Functionality
- Implemented a REST API to search employees based on `department` or `position`.
- Results are dynamically filtered and returned to the frontend.

---

## Frontend Implementation

### Technologies Used (Frontend)
- **ReactJS** (CRA)
- **Material-UI** for Professional UI Design
- **Axios** for API Calls
- **React Router DOM** for Navigation

### Features
- Professional and responsive UI/UX.
- Seamless CRUD operations for employees.
- Form validation for all user inputs.
- JWT-based session management.

### Screens and Navigation
- **Login Screen**: User authentication with a "Sign Up" link for new users.
- **Signup Screen**: User registration with a "Back to Login" button.
- **Employee List Screen**:
  - Display all employees in a table.
  - Search employees by department or position.
  - Add, View, Update, and Delete employee records.
- **Employee Detail Screen**: View specific employee details.
- **Add Employee Screen**: Form to add new employees.
- **Update Employee Screen**: Form to update employee information.
- **Logout Button**: Clear user session and redirect to the login page.

### Session Management
- User tokens are stored in `localStorage` upon successful login.
- Tokens are cleared upon logout to secure user sessions.

---

## Deployment

### Docker Setup
- **Docker Compose** orchestrates:
  - Backend (Node.js/Express)
  - Frontend (ReactJS)
  - MongoDB (Database)
- Individual `Dockerfile`s are created for each service.

### Cloud Deployment
- Optionally, the app can be deployed to platforms like **Heroku**, **Render**, or **Vercel** for live access.
